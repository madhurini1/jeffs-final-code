# Instructions for Pulling my Code


## Getting my "Latest"

1. Tell Jeff to push his code.
2. After he does, open a terminal and type `cd .\class\jeffs-code\`
3. Type `git pull` (this will pull the commits from Github that you don't have into your local clone.)
4. Profit! (copy stuff out of there you need!)

## If you want to reset `jeffs-code`:
1. Delete the folder `jeffs-code` from your class directory.
2. Open a terminal and type `cd .\class`
3. Paste this command: `gh repo clone hypertheory-services/beginning-service-development-nov-2023 jeffs-code`
